CS-E4890 Deep Learning
==============================================================

This repository contains my solutions to exercises of the course Deep Learning,
which provided an in-depth learning experience to concepts of and different
neural networks along with their architectures encountered in the realm of
deep learning.

Some of the code segments were provided as templates by the course.
For anyone interested learning more about deep learning,
I highly recommend one to take a look at Deep Learning course in Aalto University.
